# PackX CLI Prototype (Obsolete)

This old CLI prototype is deprecated.

Usage (prototype):

packx encode <input.json> <output.px>
packx decode <input.px> <output.json>

Notes:
- This prototype targeted an early internal format and is not compatible with v2.
- The current CLI uses "pack" and "unpack".
